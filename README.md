# Genesect
A tool used to merge split image disc files. 

Genesect is a simple tool which can be used to combine two split image disc files (known as ISOs) into one. This is particularly useful when it comes to merging image disc files for backup video games, such as for the Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 3, however it could be used for more general reasons as well if you so choose.

This tool was only made as a quick project to be done in a few days, so it is flawed in some aspects. Later on, I do plan on improving the application's speed and possibly allowing more than two files to be combined together in one go. Genesect is written in Python, and uses the Tkinter package.

This tool has been tested and can be used on Windows operating systems. An executable file has been provided for general use.
